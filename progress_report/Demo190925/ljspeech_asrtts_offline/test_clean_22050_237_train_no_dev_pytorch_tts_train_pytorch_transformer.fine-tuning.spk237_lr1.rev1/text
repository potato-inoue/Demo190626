237_134500_000036_000000 MARIE CLASPED HER HANDS AND STARTED UP FROM HER SEAT.
237_134500_000036_000001 SHE HAD GROWN VERY PALE AND HER EYES WERE SHINING WITH EXCITEMENT AND DISTRESS BUT EMIL IF I UNDERSTAND AND ALL OUR GOOD TIMES ARE OVER WE CAN NEVER DO NICE THINGS TOGETHER ANY MORE.
237_134500_000036_000002 WE SHALL HAVE TO BEHAVE LIKE MISTER LINDSTROM.
237_134500_000036_000003 AND ANYHOW THERE'S NOTHING TO UNDERSTAND SHE STRUCK THE GROUND WITH HER LITTLE FOOT FIERCELY.
237_134500_000036_000004 THAT WON'T LAST.
237_134500_000036_000005 IT WILL GO AWAY AND THINGS WILL BE JUST AS THEY USED TO I WISH YOU WERE A CATHOLIC.
237_134500_000036_000006 THE CHURCH HELPS PEOPLE INDEED IT DOES.
237_134500_000036_000007 I PRAY FOR YOU BUT THAT'S NOT THE SAME AS IF YOU PRAYED YOURSELF.
237_134500_000037_000001 STOOD DEFIANT GAZING DOWN AT HER.
237_134500_000038_000000 I CAN'T PRAY TO HAVE THE THINGS I WANT HE SAID SLOWLY AND I WON'T PRAY NOT TO HAVE THEM NOT IF I'M DAMNED FOR IT.
237_134500_000039_000000 MARIE TURNED AWAY WRINGING HER HAND.
237_134500_000040_000000 YES OVER.
237_134500_000040_000001 I NEVER EXPECT TO HAVE ANY MORE.
237_134500_000041_000000 AMY GRIPPED THE HANDLES OF HIS SCYTHE AND BEGAN TO MOW.
237_134500_000041_000001 MARIE TOOK UP HER CHERRIES AND WENT SLOWLY TOWARD THE HOUSE CRYING BITTERLY.
