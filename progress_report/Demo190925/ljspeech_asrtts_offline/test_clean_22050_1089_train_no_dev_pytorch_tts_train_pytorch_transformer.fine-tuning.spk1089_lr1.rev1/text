1089_134691_000049_000001 HER EYES HAD CALLED HIM AND HIS SOUL HAD LEAPED AT THE CALL.
1089_134691_000049_000002 TO LIVE TO AIR TO FALL TO TRIUMPH TO RECREATE LIFE OUT OF LIFE.
1089_134691_000049_000003 A WILD ANGEL HAD APPEARED TO HIM THE ANGEL OF MORTAL YOUTH AND BEAUTY AND ENVOY FROM THE FAIR COURTS OF LIFE TO THROW OPEN BEFORE HIM IN AN INSTANT OF ECSTASY THE GATES OF ALL THE WAYS OF ERROR AND GLORY.
1089_134691_000050_000002 WHAT HOUR WAS IT.
1089_134691_000052_000000 HE FELT ABOVE HIM THE VAST INDIFFERENT DOME AND THE CALM PROCESSES OF THE HEAVENLY BODIES AND THE EARTH BENEATH HIM THE EARTH THAT HAD BORNE HIM HAD TAKEN HIM TO HER BREAST.
1089_134691_000053_000001 HIS EYELIDS TREMBLED AS IF THEY FELT THE VAST SICKLY MOVEMENT OF THE EARTH AND HER WATCHERS TREMBLED AS IF THEY FELT THE STRANGE LIGHT OF SOME NEW WORLD.
1089_134691_000053_000002 HIS SOUL WAS SWOONING INTO SOME NEW WORLD FANTASTIC DIM UNCERTAIN AS UNDER SEA TRAVERSED BY CLOUDY SHAPES AND BEINGS.
1089_134691_000053_000003 A WORLD A GLIMMER OR A FLOWER.
1089_134691_000054_000000 EVENING HAD FALLEN WHEN HE WOKE AND THE SAND AND ARID GRASSES OF HIS BED GLOWED NO LONGER.
1089_134691_000055_000000 HE CLIMBED TO THE CREST OF THE SAND HILL AND GAZED ABOUT HIM.
