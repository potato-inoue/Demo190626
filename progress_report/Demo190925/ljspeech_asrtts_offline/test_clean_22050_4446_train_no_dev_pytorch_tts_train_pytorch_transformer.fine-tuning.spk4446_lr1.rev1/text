4446_2275_000044_000005 I WILL DO ANYTHING YOU SAY BUT THAT.
4446_2275_000044_000006 I WILL ASK THE LEAST IMAGINABLE BUT I MUST HAVE SOMETHING.
4446_2275_000045_000000 BARTLEY TURNED AWAY AND SANK DOWN IN HIS CHAIR AGAIN.
4446_2275_000045_000001 HELD A SAT ON THE ARM OF IT AND PUT HER HANDS LIGHTLY ON HIS SHOULDERS.
4446_2275_000046_000000 JUST SOMETHING BARTLEY.
4446_2275_000046_000001 I MUST HAVE YOU TO THINK OF THROUGH THE MONTHS AND MONTHS OF LONELINESS.
4446_2275_000046_000002 I MUST SEE YOU.
4446_2275_000046_000003 I MUST KNOW ABOUT YOU.
4446_2275_000046_000004 THE SIGHT OF YOU BARTLEY TO SEE YOU LIVING AND HAPPY AND SUCCESSFUL CAN I NEVER MAKE YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT THAT MEANS TO ME SHE PRESSED HIS SHOULDERS GENTLY.
4446_2275_000046_000005 YOU SEE LOVING SOMEONE AS I LOVE YOU MAKES THE WHOLE WORLD DIFFERENT.
4446_2275_000046_000006 I'D MET YOU LATER IF I HADN'T LOVED YOU SO WELL BUT THAT'S ALL OVER LONG AGO.
4446_2275_000046_000007 THEN CAME ALL THOSE YEARS WITHOUT YOU LONELY AND HURT AND DISCOURAGED THOSE DECENT YOUNG FELLOWS AND POOR MAC AND ME NEVER HEEDING HARD AS A STEEL SPRING.
4446_2275_000046_000008 AND THEN YOU CAME BACK NOT CARING VERY MUCH BUT IT MADE NO DIFFERENCE.
4446_2275_000047_000000 SHE SLID TO THE FLOOR BESIDE HIM AS IF SHE WERE TOO TIRED TO SIT UP ANY LONGER.
4446_2275_000047_000001 BARTLEY BENT OVER AND TOOK HER IN HIS ARMS KISSING HER MOUTH AND HER WET TIRED EYES.
4446_2275_000048_000000 DON'T CRY DON'T CRY HE WHISPERED.
4446_2275_000048_000001 WE'VE TORTURED EACH OTHER ENOUGH FOR TO NIGHT.
4446_2275_000048_000002 FORGET EVERYTHING EXCEPT THAT I AM HERE.
