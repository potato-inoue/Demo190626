8230_279154_000028_000004 I DO NOT WISH TO UNDERTAKE THE ANALYSIS OF BELIEF AT PRESENT SINCE IT WILL BE THE SUBJECT OF THE TWELFTH LECTURE FOR THE PRESENT I MERELY WISH TO EMPHASIZE THE FACT THAT RECOGNITION IN OUR SECOND SENSE CONSISTS IN A BELIEF WHICH WE MAY EXPRESS APPROXIMATELY IN THE WORDS THIS HAS EXISTED BEFORE.
8230_279154_000029_000001 TO BEGIN WITH IT MIGHT SEEM AT FIRST SIGHT MORE CORRECT TO DEFINE RECOGNITION AS I HAVE SEEN THIS BEFORE THAN AS THIS HAS EXISTED BEFORE WE RECOGNIZE A THING IT MAY BE URGED AS HAVING BEEN IN OUR EXPERIENCE BEFORE WHATEVER THAT MAY MEAN OR WE DO NOT RECOGNIZE IT AS MERELY HAVING BEEN IN THE WORLD BEFORE.
8230_279154_000029_000002 I AM NOT SURE THAT THERE IS ANYTHING SUBSTANTIAL IN THIS POINT.
8230_279154_000029_000003 THE DEFINITION OF MY EXPERIENCE IS DIFFICULT BROADLY SPEAKING IT IS EVERYTHING THAT IS CONNECTED WITH WHAT I AM EXPERIENCING NOW BY CERTAIN LINKS OF WHICH THE VARIOUS FORMS OF MEMORY ARE AMONG THE MOST IMPORTANT.
8230_279154_000029_000004 THUS IF I RECOGNIZE A THING THE OCCASION OF ITS PREVIOUS EXISTENCE IN VIRTUE OF WHICH I RECOGNISE IT FORMS PART OF MY EXPERIENCE BY DEFINITION RECOGNITION WILL BE ONE OF THE MARKS BY WHICH MY EXPERIENCE IS SINGLED OUT FROM THE REST OF THE WORLD.
8230_279154_000029_000005 OF COURSE THE WORDS THIS HAS EXISTED BEFORE ARE A VERY INADEQUATE TRANSLATION OF WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENS WHEN WE FORM A JUDGMENT OF RECOGNITION BUT THAT IS UNAVOIDABLE WORDS ARE FRAMED TO EXPRESS A LEVEL OF THOUGHT WHICH IS BY NO MEANS PRIMITIVE AND ARE QUITE INCAPABLE OF EXPRESSING SUCH AN ELEMENTARY OCCURRENCE AS A LEVEL OF THOUGHT.
